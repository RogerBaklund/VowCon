VowCon
-------

This package provides two classes which can be used for analyzing text with regards
to patterns of vowels and consonants. In natural language, there is a certain balance
between the two: there are rarely very many consecutive consonants or vowels in a 
real word.

Many spambots include a randomly generated word in their payload, these words will
fail the tests provided by this package.
